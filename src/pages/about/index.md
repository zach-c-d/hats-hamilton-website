  title: Who We Are
  description: >-
    HATS is a grassroots, incorporated non profit that aims to ease the
    homelessness crisis in Hamilton, where the current shelter system is often
    at full capacity and unable to meet the individual needs of a number of
    homeless persons.


    Our organization is currently funded solely by donations and grants. 


    We're  governed by a corporate board and steering committee that includes professionals with years of non-profit experience, serving the unhoused and marginalized members of the Hamilton community.


    Weâ€™ve trained more than 50 volunteers, secured donations and insurance, and coordinated support service delivery with existing agencies.


    This includes two trained staff who will be seconded to the site by Wesley Urban Ministries.
