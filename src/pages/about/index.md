Weâ€™re tackling homelessness in
practical ways by setting up warm and safe tiny cabins
for those living unhoused in our community.

The cabins are intended as a temporary solution to fill the systemic gaps in the current housing crisis.
Person-centred wrap-around support services are provided to residents, and the model embraces Housing First principles and will operate from an anti-oppressive lens. The HATS community will be designed and informed by those with lived experience.

**Help us build an organization that drives social entrepreneurship, education, healing, change and empowerment.**
