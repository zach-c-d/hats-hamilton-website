  title: About Us
  description: >
    We’re tackling homelessness in practical ways by setting up warm and safe tiny cabins for those living unhoused in our community.


    The cabins are intended as a temporary solution to fill the systemic gaps in the current housing crisis.
    Person-centred wrap-around support services are provided to residents, and the model embraces Housing First principles and will operate from an anti-oppressive lens. The HATS community will be designed and informed by those with lived experience.


    Help us build an organization that drives social entrepreneurship, education, healing, change and empowerment.

    There’s a railway bridge just steps from where I live.
    A friend and I were crossing it last winter, when I looked down and realized we were walking over someone’s makeshift home.
