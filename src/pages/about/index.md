  title: Who We Are
  description: >-
    We are a grassroots nonprofit organization in Hamilton, Ontario run entirely
    by dedicated volunteers and funded through private donations and grants,
    committed to stabilizing our village members and the neighbourhood.


    We provide safe, temporary, supportive housing with heating and air conditioning for our village members' comfort. Additionally, HATS is developing partnerships with health-care providers and social service agencies to provide on-site support to village residents including recreational programming to help them prepare for the transition to permanent housing opportunities.


    We strive to meet the neighbourhood's needs by providing an aesthetically appealing well-maintained village of tiny homes, community gardens, and a secure environment with 24/7 security.
