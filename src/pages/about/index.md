    We’re tackling homelessness in practical ways by setting up warm and safe
    tiny cabins for those living unhoused in our community.


    The cabins are intended as a temporary solution to fill the systemic gaps in the current housing crisis. Person-centred wrap-around support services are provided to residents, and the model embraces Housing First principles and will operate from an anti-oppressive lens. The HATS community will be designed and informed by those with lived experience.


    **Help us build an organization that drives social entrepreneurship, education, healing, change and empowerment.**

    There’s a railway bridge just steps from where I live.

    A friend and I were crossing it last winter, when I looked down and realized we were walking over someone’s makeshift home.


    It’s not hard to see homelessness in our city; there are sad, weary and weathered figures of all ages at stop lights, holding cardboard signs and asking for money.   


    Rather than ignore them, I wind down the window, give them change and say hello. I hope it helps.  At least it makes me feel like I'm doing something.


    But I felt helpless about someone near my home living crouched on a concrete ledge above the railway lines in the freezing cold. 


    What could I do?    


    That night, a story about tiny shelters popped up on my newsfeed.


    I sent a message to the newspaper reporter and he put me in touch with the organizers of A Better Tent City in Kitchener.  The information gathering began – many, many hours on the phone, emails and texts.


    One well-networked person in particular (Ted McMeekin, former Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing for Ontario ) put the word out, and very quickly we brought together an amazing team of smart and dedicated people. 


    Our goal – to create a new way for people living on the street to be in a temporary, safe home before they can move into a more permanent one of their own.  


    And that’s how HATS was born.
