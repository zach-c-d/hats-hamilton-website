We’re excited to share some updates on the progress of the HATS Tiny Home Village and Program over the past few months.

Since early August, a core group of dedicated volunteers have been hard at work at our construction site, building several tiny homes that bring us closer to our goal of providing safe, supportive housing for those in need.

At the September 18th council meeting, Hamilton City Council made a pivotal decision by approving the establishment of an 80-unit sanctioned encampment at the Tiffany-Barton location. In addition, they committed to working with HATS to develop our tiny home village in parallel, with a goal of completion by year’s end.

Following this positive development, city staff shared that they have a potential site in mind for the HATS village and proposed a partnership with St. Matthew’s House to manage the village’s operations. We believe this collaboration will be a powerful one, and we’re actively working to finalize the details as soon as the city confirms the site.

We’re confident that, together, we will continue to make meaningful strides toward building a sustainable, transformative village that will create a lasting impact in our city this winter.

Thank you for being an essential part of this journey. 
We’ll keep you updated as we move forward, and we look forward to sharing more exciting news in the very near future!
