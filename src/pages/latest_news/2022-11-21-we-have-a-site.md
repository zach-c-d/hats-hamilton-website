We’re thrilled to announce we have a site to call home! Our tiny home community will be temporarily located at 647 Barton St. East, Hamilton. The site is located at the corner of Barton and Earl streets.

Our goal is to have a dozen residents in their tiny homes by the coming holiday season. The snow started this week in our region, and the temperatures have plummeted. Finding shelter from the winter weather is life and death for our unhoused neighbours.

WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW!

Each cabin costs $5,000 to build, covering construction materials, a heater, a bed, a fridge and a microwave. PLUS, we have infrastructure needs for security, hydro, water, showers, a kitchen trailer and staff hiring.
