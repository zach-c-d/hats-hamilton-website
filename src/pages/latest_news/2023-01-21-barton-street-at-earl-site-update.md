Dear Neighbours,

The Hamilton Alliance for Tiny Shelters would like to extend our appreciation to the many people who attended two community information sessions at Tim Horton's Field in November.  

We were seeking feedback on the proposal to create a small community of tiny cabins for people experiencing homelessness.  

Although there was a lot of interest and support for the idea and to assist unhoused community members, we also heard concerns about some of the challenges of that particular location on Barton Street at Earl. The HATS Board has decided to not move forward with the Barton and Earl Street site, and extend our thanks to the property owner, Bill Curran for his kind offer. 

We continue to believe the HATS project is absolutely critical to help stabilize the lives of unhoused community members and will work with the City of Hamilton to try to find an optimal location.

Thanks
