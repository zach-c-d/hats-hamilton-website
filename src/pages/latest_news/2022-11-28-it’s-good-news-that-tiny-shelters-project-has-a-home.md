At last, HATS has a home. The Hamilton Alliance for Tiny Shelters [announced last week](https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2022/11/16/homeless-housing-barton-street-east.html) that the first of the tiny cabins intended to house houseless Hamiltonians will be located in the Gibson neighbourhood on Barton Street East.

This is very good news. But [not everyone is happy](https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2022/11/19/homeless-tiny-homes-barton-street-east.html). More on that later.

For now, let’s review what HATS is, and what it is not. HATS proposes to house a segment of the homeless population in a cluster of 10-square-metre cabins. Inside the tiny cabin is a bed, shelving and electricity outlets. There is insulation, but no indoor plumbing. Washroom and kitchen facilities will be separate.

What this is not is a permanent solution to a lack of safe, affordable housing. It’s a temporary solution, better than sleeping on the streets or in tents. Clustering the tiny houses makes providing support and oversight easier than with residents putting up tents and then being displaced and scattered on a regular basis.

But the cabins are only temporary, to offer warm and safe options while more long-term housing options are being developed. Like the tiny shelter philosophy overall, the Barton Street location is not intended to be permanent. The property, a parking lot owned by Hamilton architect Bill Curran, will eventually house a four-storey commercial-residential structure. But that development is down the road. In the mean time, the empty lot can serve a valuable purpose for reducing tent encampments and people sleeping rough, while also testing whether the HATS philosophy works here, as it is already doing in numerous other urban centres, including Kitchener and Vancouver. After a couple of years, the tiny house settlement will have to move to a different location.

That, we would argue, is where Hamilton city council can help. HATS got a marginally supportive, but muted, reception from the last city council. Many agreed the idea has merit and worth trying this pilot project, and city staff have been supportive, but overall council didn’t get solidly behind the idea.

This time, it could and should. City hall owns a lot of land across the city. It may not be wise or possible for some of that to be a more lasting home for the HATS community, but at least a public commitment of political support would help the alliance in its search for a permanent or longer-term site.

One of the reasons the previous council, hopefully not this one, was reluctant to get fully on board with HATS is neighbourhood sensitivity. There are a lot of Hamiltonians who agree with what the tiny shelter pilot is trying to achieve, provided it’s not in their neighbourhood. It’s a good idea, but just not here, is the common refrain.

Not surprisingly, the Barton location is not supported by everyone. Critics of the location point out that the area already has more than its share of social services, which is true. But the services are there because that is where the population that needs them lives.

That said, it would be unfair to dismiss neighbourhood concerns. These folks live in the area, and have a vested interest in maintaining security and standards.

Fair enough. But the community will have fencing, lighting, security staff, 24-7 staffing, video cameras and regular presence from street-level programs. Residents will also go through an interview process and will sign an agreement. These seem like reasonable protocols that should mitigate risk. And bear in mind, some of the residents almost certainly live in the neighbourhood now, just not in secure housing.

The city’s current approach to tent encampments has not been successful overall. It has resulted in residents being displaced to move a few blocks away, only to repeat the cycle. Rather than continuing to do what we know hasn’t worked, we hope city hall, council, and the residents of Gibson and Stipley can support this pilot project. Let’s give HATS a chance to succeed.
