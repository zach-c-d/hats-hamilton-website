Super excited to finally share this! Just in time to get your mothers day gifts and in partnership with Cornell Performance Academy we have 30+ local vendors, live music with Chris Chambers kids corner with Learning with Lexi  refreshments and snacks with the Green Machine Food Truck. 

The first 50 people will receive gift bags and donations from the incredible vendors and much much more to announce as the date approaches! Also, as we have always done, there will be some fab door prizes!
