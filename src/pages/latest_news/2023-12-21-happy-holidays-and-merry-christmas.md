Dear Supporters and Friends of HATS,

As we approach the end of the year, we want to extend our warmest holiday wishes to everyone. Your support has been the cornerstone of our efforts, and we are truly grateful for your dedication and generosity.

It has been an evolving period for HATS since our decision not to proceed with the city-proposed Strachan site. Despite this, we've remained proactive and dedicated to our mission. 

Here are the key highlights of our recent activities:

1. Addressing Immediate Needs
   Although we could not establish a village in time for this winter, our incredible volunteer base mobilized swiftly to assemble 500 gift bags for distribution at THE HUB in December. The outpouring of contributions and support from donors, partners, individuals, and faith communities has been heartening.
2. Ongoing Fundraising and HATS Awareness
   Our annual HATS fundraiser with Dan Medakovic and The Fry Truck Band is scheduled for December 21st at Casbah Night Club. Additionally, we've composed a HATS Christmas song written, composed and donated by HATS supporter Jim Irvine, which is available for sale on CD at the SOLD OUT event and online on our website https://hamiltontinyshelters.ca/
3. Continuous Improvement to the HATS Model
   As practical, site selection criteria are being refined to accommodate the needs of all stakeholders.
4. Ongoing Search for a Pilot Site
   We've been evaluating new site candidates and reassessing previously examined locations. We intend to submit a proposal in January to recommend an alternative location for a HATS village implementation by mid-2024.
5. Securing Political Will
   We are grateful for Council's endorsement of a 2-year HATS pilot, we remain optimistic about bringing a HATS implementation to fruition by mid-2024. Additionally, we have extended an invitation to meet with the Mayor and are hopeful to discuss the next steps in mid to late January. 

Thank you all for your ongoing support and commitment to our cause. Your contributions have been invaluable in driving us closer to our goal of establishing our Tiny Homes Program and offering support to those in need. 

We are wishing you a joyous holiday season and a prosperous New Year!
