FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


Title: Hamilton Alliance for Tiny Shelters (HATS) Announces Decision Regarding
Strachan Linear Park Site for Pilot Project


Hamilton, \[October 6th, 2023] - Having completed its due diligence, the Hamilton
Alliance for Tiny Shelters (HATS) Board of Directors, with the total support of its
Leadership Team, unanimously voted not to proceed with its Pilot on the city proposed Strachan Linear Park site. The organization felt too many of its essential site
selection criteria were not being fully met, which would severely compromise the
success of the Pilot to the detriment of all of its community partners. While the
Strachan site addressed some of the needs of the HATS project, the due diligence
process led HATS to conclude that the investment required was too significant.


HATS expresses deep disappointment that it cannot move forward with a site at this
time, which had the potential to provide much-needed stability, safety, and warmth to
unhoused individuals, particularly as the winter months approach. HATS, however, is
moving ahead in collaboration with the City to identify other possible sites for a Pilot
implementation targeted for mid-2024.


Additionally, a number of partners, including LIUNA, have offered their support for
the HATS Model and will also be collaborating with HATS to identify additional
potential sites. HATS will follow due process in engaging the community prior to
selecting a future site.


HATS appreciates the ongoing support from Mayor Horwath and Hamilton City
Council, particularly Councillor Cameron Kroetsch, as HATS strives to bring the Tiny
Homes project to fruition.


HATS thanks the North End community members who engaged with HATS
presenting HATS with the opportunity to elaborate further on the finer details of the
Tiny Homes Program. HATS continues to refine and strengthen its innovative,
compassionate and human-centred approach to helping mitigate the impacts of
homelessness.


Please note that the City has also released a public update on this matter, available at
