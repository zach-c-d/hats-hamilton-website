We're reaching out to provide you with a brief update on our recent progress at the Hamilton Alliance for Tiny Shelters (HATS). We value your continued interest in our work and want to keep you informed.

HATS is currently collaborating with the City to explore potential sites for a Pilot implementation, with a targeted timeline of mid-2024. This is a significant step in our commitment to supporting our most vulnerable.

Furthermore, we are appreciative of the support we have received from various partners, including LIUNA, who are working with us as we examine potential sites. Please be assured that HATS is devoted to following due process, including community engagement, before making any final site selection. 

Your support is invaluable to us as we move forward. We'll be keeping you informed as our work progresses. Our mission remains our driving force, and we are grateful for your ongoing involvement.

Stay tuned for more updates in the near future.
