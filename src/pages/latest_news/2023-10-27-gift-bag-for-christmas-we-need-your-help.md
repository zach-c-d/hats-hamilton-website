As we draw closer to the holiday season, the Hamilton Alliance for Tiny Shelters (HATS), is launching our **"Gift Bag for Christmas"** collection initiative. This supports our ongoing partnership with the HUB, a Hamilton Nonprofit Organization working directly with unhoused individuals.

We aim to collect 150 gift bags, each filled with critical essentials necessary for those unhoused.

*We are seeking men's and women’s items for our gift bags as follows:*

* Gloves and Mittens
* Hand warmers and foot warmers
* Socks
* Underwear (men’s and women’s briefs)
* Winter hats
* Granola bars
* Mini flashlights
* $10 Tim Hortons gift cards
* Deodorant, toothbrushes, mini toothpaste, hotel-sized soaps
* Band-aids and first-aid supplies
* Chapstick
* Nail clippers, comb, hairbrush
* Reusable water bottle
* Mini chocolate bars
* New or gently used blankets
* Reusable Thermos or Coffee Mug
* New or gently Used Blankets

Together, we have the extraordinary capacity to impact the lives of those in need profoundly, and we couldn't be prouder to have you as part of the HATS family.

For any questions, to arrange pick-up, or to explore how you can contribute to this cause, please get in touch with Debra at debraleahhartman@gmail.com.

**The deadline for collection is December 9th.**

WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT!!
