  A big thank you to the Hamilton Spectator for chatting with us at HATS to talk
  about our projects to help the unhoused #OneCabinAtATime 


  We also want to thank the continued support, as mentioned in this article, not only from all of your donations but from the students of Westdale Secondary School with their work completed on building one of the cabins.
