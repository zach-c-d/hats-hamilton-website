  Transcript: Can Tiny Shelters Bridge the Homelessness Gap? | Sep 16, 2022

  ﻿Jeyan Jeganathan sits in The Agenda studio with his hands crossed at a desk with papers and a glass of water. He wears a burgundy suit jacket over a white shirt and plaid tie. He has short dark hair and neatly trimmed beard. On a monitor, the Ontario Hubs logo is displayed.


  Jeyan says, COULD SO-CALLED TINY


  HOMES BE A BIG PART OF THE


  SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT


  ADEQUATE HOUSING IN HAMILTON?


  Beside The Agenda logo, a lowercase letter a., text reads, Jeyan Jeganathan, @jeyanTVO, @theagenda.


  Jeyan says, JUSTIN CHANDLER COVERS


  HAMILTON-NIAGARA FOR OUR ONTARIO


  HUBS.


  Text reads, Can Tiny Shelters Bridge the Homelessness Gap?



  Jeyan says, HE RECENTLY HEARD HOW THE


  EXPERIENCE IN KITCHENER COULD


  OFFER SOME ANSWERS FOR THE


  HAMMER.


  AND THAT'S WHERE WE FIND HIM


  TONIGHT.


  WELCOME, JUSTIN


  In a video call, Justin sits in front of a black bookcase with glass doors. A microphone stand and shelving unit stand beside the bookcase. Justin has brown hair that’s parted to the side and wears a blue suit jacker over a blue shirt and patterned tie.


  He says, HELLO.


  Jeyan says, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE


  HAMILTON ALLIANCE FOR TINY


  SHELTERS.


  WHAT IS IT?




  Text reads, Can Tiny Shelters Bridge the Homelessness Gap?




  Justin says, THE HAMILTON


  ALLIANCE FOR TINY SHELTERS IS A


  GROUP OF I GUESS LIKE-MINDED


  INDIVIDUALS, SOME OF THEM FROM


  LONGSTANDING COMMUNITY


  ORGANIZATIONS IN THE CITY, LIKE


  THE SOCIAL PLANNING AND RESEARCH


  COUNCIL OR THE POVERTY REDUCTION


  ROUNDTABLE, BUT ALSO I THINK


  PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE NEW TO THIS


  BUT WHO ARE REALLY KEEN ON THE


  IDEA OF TINY HOMES, AND TINY


  HOMES SPECIFICALLY AS A SOLUTION


  TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY


  LIVING IN ENCAMPMENTS.


  Text reads, Justin Chandler, Hamilton-Niagara Hub Journalist.



  Jeyan says, SO THERE IS A


  SIMILAR PROJECT IN


  KITCHENER-WATERLOO AREA.


  WHAT ARE TINY SHELTERS MEANT TO


  DO FOR A CITY AND SORT OF THE


  FABRIC OF COMMUNITY THERE?




  Justin says, YEAH.


  I GUESS THE BEST WAY TO START IS


  JUST TO SORT OF LOOK AT WHAT WE


  CURRENTLY HAVE IN A LOT OF


  PLACES, WHICH IS PEOPLE WHO, FOR


  WHATEVER REASON, CAN'T OR DON'T


  WANT TO GET INTO SHELTERS,


  THERE'S A LOT OF VALID REASONS


  AROUND THAT THAT WE WON'T GET


  INTO RIGHT NOW, BUT WHO END UP


  LIVING IN TENT ENCAMPMENTS.



  Text reads, Justin Chandler, @mr_lois_lane.



  Justin says, AND THE IDEA WITH A TINY HOMES


  COMMUNITY IS THAT THIS COULD BE


  A BETTER SAFER OPTION THAN THAT.


  ENCAMPMENTS ARE OFTEN ILLEGAL SO


  PEOPLE ARE ON THE RUN FROM


  BY-LAW WHO ARE CONSTANTLY TAKING


  DOWN TENTS AND MOVING THEM


  AROUND.


  THE IDEA WITH THIS IS PEOPLE


  COULD HAVE A SAFE LOCATION WHERE


  THEY COULD LIVE WHILE THEY WAIT


  TO GET INTO PERHAPS SOCIAL


  HOUSING OR GET ON THEIR FEET AND


  BE ABLE TO GET


  INTO SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT.


  BUT WHERE THEY WOULD BE SAFE AND


  WHERE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SERVICES


  COULD REACH OUT TO AND ASSIST THEM.


  IT'S REALLY SAYING WHAT'S


  CURRENTLY HAPPENING AND FIND


  SOMETHING THAT'S BETTER THAN


  THAT.



  Jeyan nods.



  He says, OKAY.


  SO YOU SPOKE TO A CONSULTANT ON


  THE HAMILTON PROJECT.


  I'M CURIOUS: WHAT DID HE SAY WAS


  THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF


  GAINING APPROVAL FOR TINY


  PROJECTS AND TINY HOMES, BECAUSE


  WE CAN IMAGINE THERE'S A LOT OF


  RED TAPE, A LOT OF POLICY THAT


  YOU HAVE TO GET THROUGH.



  Justin says, MM-HMM.



  He nods.



  He says, THAT WAS TONY D'AMATO-STORTZ,


  WHO HAS JUST WRITTEN A BOOK


  ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS.



  A laptop is displayed with a tvotoday article open titled, ‘A port in a storm’; How to build a tiny-home community.



  Justin says, AND REALLY HE SAID THE BIGGEST


  MOST DIFFICULT THING IS ACTUALLY


  JUST FINDING A PLACE AND GETTING


  THE POLITICAL WILL.



  Text reads, TVO.org/OntarioHubs.



  Justin says, HE SAID IT'S NOT EASY TO SET UP


  ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES, BUT


  THAT'S NOT THE MOST CHALLENGING


  PART.


  THE MOST CHALLENGING PART IS


  FINDING A PLACE WHERE IT'S LEGAL


  TO SET THIS UP, WHERE YOU CAN


  GET IT ZONED PROPERLY, YOU CAN


  GET THE HOOKUPS THAT YOU NEED


  FOR ELECTRICITY, WHERE THE


  NEIGHBOURS AREN'T GOING TO BE


  FIGHTING IT.


  SO REALLY HE SAID IT'S MORE OF A


  POLITICAL CHALLENGE AT THIS


  POINT FOR HAMILTON OR FOR ANYONE


  WHO IS TRYING TO SET SOMETHING


  UP AT THE BEGINNING.



  Jeyan says, ALL RIGHT.


  I KNOW WE HAVE SOME PHOTOS OF


  THESE TINY SHELTERS.


  LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME.



  A photo of a tiny shelter is displayed.



  Jeyan says, THIS IS WHAT A TINY SHELTER


  WOULD LOOK LIKE FROM THE


  OUTSIDE.


  DO YOU KNOW THE DIMENSIONS OF


  THIS STRUCTURE AS WELL?


  Justin says, YES, EIGHT BY TEN FEET.


  Jeyan says, EIGHT BY TEN, SO


  WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE


  WINDOW.


  WE DO HAVE AN ENTRANCE INSIDE,


  IT'S DECKED OUT WITH A MINI


  FRIDGE AND A MICROWAVE.


  A photo is displayed of a microwave and mini-fridge inside a home.


  Jeyan says, I FOUND THIS INTERESTING.


  THE ENTRYWAY, THERE WAS A BIT OF


  CONVERSATION ABOUT SOMETHING


  THAT I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE


  DON'T THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF


  DOORS OPENING IN AND OUT.


  WALK ME THROUGH THAT STORY.



  Justin says, YEAH.


  TONY WAS EXPLAINING THAT FOR A


  LOT OF US, WE'RE USING TO OUR


  DOORS OPENING INWARDS.


  BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE


  ENDED UP FINDING OUT WITH A


  BETTER TENT CITY IN KITCHENER


  WHERE HE WAS A SUPERINTENDENT


  FOR A YEAR WAS THAT PEOPLE


  ACTUALLY PREFERRED OUTSWINGING


  DOORS.


  Text reads, Justin Chandler, @mr_lois_lane.


  Justin says, AND ORIGINALLY THEY HAD JUST


  DONE THIS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT


  IT WOULD GIVE PEOPLE MORE SPACE


  INSIDE.


  BUT PEOPLE ACTUALLY FELT IT WAS


  A LOT SAFER.


  BECAUSE IF SOMEONE CAME AND


  KICKED YOUR DOOR OR WAS TRYING


  TO FORCE THEIR WAY IN, THE DOOR


  IS NOT OPENING THAT WAY BECAUSE


  IT'S GOING OUTWARDS.


  HE SAID THIS IS REALLY A GOOD


  EXAMPLE OF WHERE LISTENING TO


  RESIDENTS AND TALKING TO THE


  PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTNERS AT THE


  SITE, WHO ARE LIVING THERE,


  ACTUALLY REALLY HELPED DO THIS


  BETTER FOR SITES IN THE FUTURE.



  Jeyan says, ONE THING WE NOTED


  IN THAT SECOND PHOTO WAS, THERE


  WAS A MICROWAVE AND A FRIDGE.



  Justin nods. The microwave and fridge photo is displayed.



  Jeyan says, SO THERE IS SOME ELECTRICITY.


  BUT THERE IS NO PLUMBING.


  I AM CURIOUS, FOR THE


  ELECTRICITY PORTION, WHO PAYS


  FOR THAT?



  Justin says, THAT DOES DEPEND ON


  THE MODEL OF THE SITE.


  SOME SITES ARE PARTIALLY FUNDED


  BY CITIES AND PARTIALLY FUNDED


  BY LIKE THE GROUPS THAT ARE


  BACKING THEM, SO I GUESS BY


  PHILANTHROPY, BY DONATIONS,


  COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.




  Text reads, Justin Chandler, @mr_lois_lane. Other text reads, Can Tiny Shelters Bridge the Homelessness Gap?




  Justin says, SOME SITES ARE FUNDED BY


  MUNICIPALITIES FULLY.


  SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS


  TO BE WORKED OUT FOR EACH SITE.


  BUT DEFINITELY ELECTRICITY IS


  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS


  AS FAR AS GETTING THESE SET UP


  AND IN TONY'S BOOK HE SAYS THAT


  WATER CAN BE BROUGHT IN, YOU


  COULD HAVE PORT-A-POTTIES.


  IF YOU CAN'T GET ACCESS TO A


  PHYSICAL WASHROOM BUILDING.


  BUT ELECTRICITY IS NECESSARY FOR


  HEAT AND FOR LIGHTING AND FOR


  ENTERTAINMENT.




  Jeyan says, LET'S LOOK AT OUR


  FINAL PHOTO.


  THIS IS A PHOTO OBVIOUSLY OF THE


  BED.




  A photo of a bed in a tiny home is displayed.




  Jeyan says, A SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE FOR A LOT


  OF PEOPLE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE


  COMPARISON OF A TENT TO A


  SHELTER LIKE THIS.


  WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CITY AND


  MAINTAINING THE SHELTER, DOES


  THE CITY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY ON


  THAT?




  Justin says, I THINK THAT WOULD


  AGAIN BE UP TO THE MODEL.


  SO FOR A MUNICIPALLY FUNDED


  SITE, PRESUMABLY THE CITY WOULD


  BE A LOT MORE ACTIVE IN THAT.




  Text reads, Justin Chandler, Hamilton-Niagara Hub Journalist.




  Justin says, BUT FOR A SITE THAT'S BEING LED


  MORE GRASS ROOTS, THEN I THINK


  THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR


  KEEPING IT UP TO CODE.


  IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT THE


  RESIDENTS DO A LOT OF THE WORK.


  TONY WAS SAYING THAT THE PEOPLE


  WHO LIVE HERE, THESE ARE THEIR


  HOMES.


  SO IF SHOVELLING NEEDS TO BE


  DONE IN THE WINTER, THE SITE


  SUPERINTENDENT CAN BUY A SHOVEL.


  BUT THEN IT'S REALLY UP TO THE


  RESIDENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THAT.


  SO IT'S NOT QUITE AS SIMPLE AS


  JUST LIKE THE CITY COMING IN AND


  DOING EVERYTHING.




  Jeyan says, I KNOW WHEN YOU WERE


  TALKING TO D'AMATO ABOUT


  THIS AS A SOLUTION TO


  HOMELESSNESS, WHAT DID HE SAY


  ABOUT THIS SORT OF BEING, IS


  THIS WHERE IT SORT OF ENDS OR IS


  THIS JUST THE BEGINNING, THE


  START?




  Justin says, HE CALLED THIS A


  PORT IN THE STORM.


  THIS IS THE MIDDLE.


  SO FOR SOMEONE WHO IS UNHOUSED


  AND WHO DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO


  SHELTER RIGHT NOW, THIS WOULD BE


  GREAT.




  Text reads, Justin Chandler, @mr_lois_lane.




  Justin says, SO IF A SITE LIKE THIS CAN TAKE


  10 OR 20 PEOPLE OUT OF


  HOMELESSNESS, OR, SORRY, I


  SHOULD SAY HOUSELESSNESS, GIVE


  THEM THAT ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD


  AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO


  SORT OF CATCH THEIR BREATH, GET


  THE PAPERWORK THAT THEY NEED IN


  ORDER TO APPLY FOR SOCIAL


  SERVICES, MAYBE BE ON A WAITLIST


  FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.


  IT'S REALLY SORT OF A SAFER


  MIDDLE STEP FOR PEOPLE.




  Jeyan nods.




  Justin adds, BUT HE SAYS IT'S DEFINITELY NOT


  THE SOLUTION TO ENDING


  HOMELESSNESS WRIT LARGE.


  THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT


  MORE SOCIAL INVESTMENT AND ALL


  SORTS OF WORK FROM VARIOUS


  SECTORS.




  Jeyan says, JUSTIN, WE HAVE


  ABOUT 30 SECONDS LEFT.


  I DO WANT TO ASK YOU, SOMETHING


  THAT OBVIOUSLY COMES UP IN THIS


  CONVERSATION IS THAT, YOU KNOW,


  NOT IN MY BACK YARD TYPE OF


  ATTITUDE.


  I KNOW THAT HE HAD SOME ADVICE


  IN TERMS OF TACKLING THAT.


  WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY?




  Justin says, WELL, ONE OF THE


  THINGS HE SAID IS THAT FOR


  PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT A


  SITE LIKE THIS, THE IMPACT IS


  PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE NEAR AS


  BIG AS THEY THINK.




  Text reads, Justin Chandler, @mr_lois_lane.




  Justin says, THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT


  WORRY PEOPLE ABOUT HAVING A


  SHELTER NEARBY OR HAVING


  UNHOUSED PEOPLE NEARBY AREN'T


  GOING TO APPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE


  ARE GOING TO BE SAFE WITHIN


  THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.


  YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO RUN


  INTO THEM THAT MUCH.


  BUT REALLY HE SAID THE MAIN


  THING TO REMEMBER IS JUST


  BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE


  HERE, THEY'RE STILL A MEMBER OF


  THE COMMUNITY AND THEY STILL


  DESERVE RESPECT AND CARE AND


  SAFETY AND HE SAID THAT'S A


  POINT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO


  MAKE.




  Jeyan says, JUSTIN, GREAT STORY,


  REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.


  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THE


  PROGRAM.




  Justin says, THANK YOU.


  TAKE CARE.
