  # Objective: Hamilton Alliance for Tiny Shelters (HATS)

  At HATS, our objective is straightforward: to address the pressing housing crisis in our community by providing warm, safe, and dignified temporary tiny homes within a village setting, complete with essential wrap-around supports, to individuals experiencing homelessness in Hamilton. We recognize the situation's urgency and are committed to taking practical steps to alleviate this crisis. Our mission centers on building a sense of belonging, safety, and dignity for every person who enters our Tiny Homes Program.

  # Who We Are

  HATS is a community-driven initiative born out of a shared determination to tackle the homelessness crisis head-on. We understand that homelessness is not just a statistic; it's a reality that affects real people, each with unique stories and needs. Our overarching mission is to ensure that no one in our community faces the harsh reality of homelessness alone. We believe in empowering individuals to cultivate the essential skills and resilience required to thrive when permanent housing opportunities become available.

  # Values That Define Us

  1.   **Compassion**: We approach our work with empathy and understanding, recognizing that homelessness can happen to anyone. Our compassion guides us in creating an environment where individuals feel valued and respected, regardless of their circumstances.

  2.   **Dignity**: We believe that every person has inherent worth and deserves to be treated with dignity. While we believe housing is a right, we recognize that the waitlist for deeply affordable housing continues to increase without an immediate solution. Our tiny home villages are designed not just as physical spaces but as places where individuals can regain their sense of self-worth and belonging and prepare them for permanent housing when they transition to that next stage.

  3.   **Collaboration**: The challenges of homelessness are too complex to be solved by one entity alone. We collaborate closely with community partners, volunteers, and local authorities to create a comprehensive support network that addresses the multifaceted needs of our village members.

  4.   **Empowerment**: We empower our village members by providing wrap-around support services and recreational programming on our village site; we help individuals regain control of their lives, work towards stability, and make informed decisions about their future.

  5.   **Resilience**: We are committed to adapting and finding temporary solutions to the challenges posed by the homelessness crisis. Our resilience drives us to continuously improve our approach and find new ways to make a lasting impact.
